# Optimization-Methods-HSE
This repository contains completed homework assignments for the "Optimization Methods" course at the Higher School of Economics (HSE). The assignments cover the following topics:

-Calculation of the net yield for i-th stock of three companies: MegaFon, Nestle, and Embracer Group. The mean and variance for each stock were calculated. The portfolio optimization problem was formulated and solved analytically and numerically in Python.

-Implementation of the steepest descent method and the conjugate gradient method in Python.
### HW 1
In the first assignment, the task was to optimize a portfolio of three stocks: MegaFon, Nestle, and Embracer Group. The net yield, mean, and variance were calculated for each stock, and the portfolio optimization problem was formulated and solved using analytical and numerical methods in Python.

### HW 2
In the second assignment, two optimization methods were implemented in Python: the steepest descent method and the conjugate gradient method. These methods are commonly used in optimization problems to find the minimum of a function. Python code was written to implement the methods and apply them to several examples.
